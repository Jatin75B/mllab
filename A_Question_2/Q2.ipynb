    "**Supervised Learning Algorithms - KNN:**  Build a KNN model for predicting if a person will have diabetes or not with a high accuracy score. Perform some appropriate Pre-Processing steps on the given dataset for better results. Implement the KNN algorithm on your own. Try other possible processes that can be done to dataset and tuning the model to increase accuracy such as Increase K value, Normalization and Different Distance Metrics. Perform Feature Ablation Study. Additional Tries: Weight the features before doing KNN prediction."
